Makes sure that when you click on the Generate buttons, the checkpoint used by the server is the one seen on your web interface (where you clicked).
This is only useful if you have multiple users on the same automatic1111 webui server.

If some other user changes the checkpoint currently loaded on the server, when you click on generate, the extension will force the server to reload your checkpoint before generating your images.
